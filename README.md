# EcoTips
EcoTips allows you to track your carbon footprint from food and transportation, which make up about 42% of your carbon emissions. There are already many ways to easily see carbon emissions from home electricity consumption, but food and transportation are challenging to track because they vary every day.

Enter EcoTips, a survey-based tracker that gives you an weekly estimate of how many kg of COâ‚‚ you generated. With EcoTips, it takes less than a minute to report your daily emissions in an easy to use interface with no ads.

EcoTips also gives you a list of tips to choose from each week for you to work on. You can then earn points by checking in each day in the app to report if you've worked on each weekly tip.

This app is currently in pre-release, so there may be certain issues with it. If you experience any bugs or have features you would like to see added, you can report them [here](https://github.com/Camshaft54/eco_tips/issues).
